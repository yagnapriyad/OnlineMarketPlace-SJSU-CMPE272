Online Market place
Online Project Marketplace is designed to bring developers and client in one platform. It helps them to interact. 
Here clients can send their project requirements to administrator. Administrator collects these details and posts in web application, 
where developers can view these projects and interested developers can select the project and post their quotations, approach and details 
about themself which would trigger an email to client, this would help client to decide if they would like to get their projects done by 
these developers or not.
